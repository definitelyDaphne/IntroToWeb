	<div class="History child">
		<p><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the standard language used to describe the meaning and structure of a web document. It was born out of <abbr title="Standard Generalized Markup Language">SGML</abbr>, so as its sibling <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, they both are markup language that specify strict rules to organise data and share without misinterpretation. The main differences are: HTML focus on how the data should look on the website/web document, and it has a fix sets of tags; while XML focus more on transport the information itself, at the same time preserve its meaning, developers are welcome to invent new tag for XML.</p>
		<p>Hypertext made the web powerful by linking extra resources and within a page. HTML and <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> together form the foundation of the world wide web, one for creation, another for delivery. The first HTML document was officially published by Tim Berners-Lee back in 1991. It's used to give a quick overlook about <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> and usage of HTML. It looks quite simple, yet perfectly demonstrate the usefulness of HTML with help of hyperlink- to share and organise web resources. <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">The link can be find in here.</a></p>
		<p>HTML has certainly evolved a lot since its creation in 1989, when only few element and limited styling option are available, at the time websites look rather dull apart from some text. The latest version to date is HTML 5 which made standard by W3C in 2014. It supports most of the modern browser, graphic canvas that allow drawing using Javascript, multimedia such as video and audio element, charset attribute in meta tag that defines the standard character encoding, self-explained layout tags such as &lt;nav&gt; tag and &lt;article&gt; tag.</p>
